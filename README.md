The code generates 100 pseudo-random lines using the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm and plots them on a new graph with boundaries at (0,0) and (1000,1000).

Generating the start and end points: The randi([0, 1000]) function is used to randomly select x and y coordinates for the start and end points of each line.

Calculating the line length: The distance between the start and end points is calculated using the formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). To simplify this, the function max(abs(dx), abs(dy)) is used, where dx = x2 - x1 and dy = y2 - y1.

Calculating the increments for x and y: If the line length is not zero, increments for x and y are calculated for each step of the line: sx = dx / len and sy = dy / len. If the line length is zero, the increments are set to zero.

Plotting the line on the graph: Using a for loop, the coordinates of each point on the line are calculated using the formulas x = x1 + jsx and y = y1 + jsy, where j is the current point number. The coordinates of each point are stored in arrays line_x and line_y. The function plot(line_x, line_y, 'k') is then used to plot the line on the graph. The function hold on is used to add the line to the current graph.
